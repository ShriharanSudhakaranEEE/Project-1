Electric vehicle sales are increasing as of 2023, and over the next five years, the EV will completely change the automotive sector. However, the charging infrastructure needs to be urgently improved because it is not up to par.

To solve this problem, we came up with the notion of automating the charging station's billing system.

The correct sensors are used to compute the amount of energy spent, and the charges for each unit consumed and the payment for each charging are sent to the consumers via SMS, making it possible for them to pay for charging. This lessens the complexity of the payment and saves the user time.
